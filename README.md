### About the project

This is a web application that suggests 10 songs similar 
to the song chosen by the user. The recommendations
are generated from around 6000 songs available
in the dataset.

* #### Content Based Filtering
    Content based filtering uses item features to 
    recommend other items similar to what the user likes,
    based on their previous actions or explicit
    feedback.

* #### Why use content based filtering
    The model doesn't need any data about other users, since
    the recommendations are specific to this user.
    This makes it easier to scale to large number of 
    users. Recommendations are also highly relevant 
    to the user.

* #### Cosine Similarity
  Cosine similarity measures the similarity between 
  two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle 
  between them. A simple visualization and the 
  formula can be found below.
